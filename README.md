# Soul Script App 🧠📝

**Soul Script** is a personal mental wellness diary web application designed to help users reflect on their thoughts, emotions, and daily experiences. Built with **React**, **Node.js**, and **MongoDB**, this platform provides a calm and secure space where users can write journal entries, track their moods, manage tasks, and view insightful analytics to better understand their mental health journey.

Due to the size of the full application (including media/models), it is hosted externally.
